Installation
============

Package
-------

To install the ``motionphoto`` Python package and executable, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m pip install motionphoto

Dependencies
------------

The Python library and corresponding executables depend on a program called
``exiftool`` created by Phil Harvey.

Instructions for installing this program can be found
`here <httsps://exiftool.org/install.html>`_, however it will likely be easier
to use your platform's native package manager.
