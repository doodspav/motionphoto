Installation
============

Package
-------

To install the **motionphoto** Python package and executable, run:

.. code-block:: shell

   python -m pip install motionphoto

Dependencies
------------

The Python library and corresponding executables depend on a program called
``exiftool``.

This can be installed from `here <httsps://exiftool.org/install.html>`_
however it will likely be easier to use your platform's native package manager.
