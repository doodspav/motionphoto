# motionphoto
Python library for creating Google and Samsung compatible Motion Photos.

Most notably this can be used to convert Live Photos downloaded from iCloud 
(where each photo comes as a separate image and video file) into Motion Photos that users
with Android can experience.

## Installation

The Python library and corresponding executables depend on a program called
`exiftool` created by Phil Harvey.

Instructions for installing this program can be found
[here](httsps://exiftool.org/install.html>), however it will likely be easier
to use your platform's native package manager.

To install the `motionphoto` Python package and executable, run:

```shell
$ python -m pip install motionphoto
```
